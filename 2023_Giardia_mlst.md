# General information

## Giardia genomes

- Highly conserved, seems like they are in intense purifying selection. Assemblages A and B are the major cause of disease in humans. Others are mostly transmitted among animals.  
        + Yet, nucleotide sequence identity between assemblages A and B is around 70%  
        + Assemblages AI and AII have ~99% similarity
- Few introns, mostly localized in genes of tRNA
- HIghly variable genes include:  
		+ Variant-specific Surface proteins (VSP). Found commonly in genomic regions with with rearrangements.  
		+ NEK kinases  
		+ High Cysteine Membrane proteins (HCMP)  
		+ Protein 21.1

## Glossary

- **dN/dS** - Nonsynonymous to synonymous, high when active selection and low when purifying selection
- **P15, WB and GS** are commonly used reference strains/genomes. The GS isolate is an assemblage B parasite. 
- **Pseudogenes** are regions with homology to a known gene or a possible ORF that lack a functional sequence necessary for transcription or have truncation or premature stop codons

## Accession numbers for available genomes

We are looking for short or long read whole genome data of G. duodenalis assemblage A or B. 

1. AACB00000000 / GCA_000002435.2 (Whole  genome of WB isolate (AI))  
2. PRJNA280606 (BCCDC primary study)
3. JXTI00000000 (primary assembly SE reads using 454 technology)
