# General information

## Giardia genomes

- Highly conserved, seems like they are in intense purifying selection
- Few introns, mostly localized in genes of tRNA
- HIghly variable genes include:  
		- Variant-specific Surface proteins (VSP). Found commonly in sections with rearrangements.  
		- NEK kinases  
		- High Cysteine Membrane proteins (HCMP)  
		- Protein 21.1

## Glossary

- **dN/dS** - Nonsynonymous to synonimous, high when active selection and low when purifying selection
- **P15, WB and GS** are commonly used reference strains/genomes. The GS isolate is an assemblage B parasite. 
- **Pseudogenes** are regions with homology to a known gene or a possible ORF that lack a functional sequence necessary for transcription or have truncation or premature stop codons
