# Introduction

This is not a project per se but more of a documentation of my experiences while learning **Nextflow**. In mid 2022 when I tried to dip my toes in **Nextflow** I had a hard time understanding the syntax and only after getting more familiar with scripting in **Python** I feel like I am up to the challenge. 

Thus, I will try to list resources to review when I need to re-visit any topic and also provide quick snippets and tips for my future scripting. Finally, as in all my other notebooks, I will register my advances with dates. 

### Useful resources

- Yearly aggregated list of resources to learn Nextflow - [2023 link](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2023/learn-nextflow-in-2023.html)
- Introduction to Nextflow form Seqera Labs, not updated to use DSL 2 (https://github.com/seqeralabs/nextflow-tutorial)
- The [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a comprehensive guide to concepts and in-depth dynamics

# Important definitions

## Input and output 

Structure to define **_input_** and **_output_**
```
input:
    <input qualifier (val,path,tuple) > <input name>

output:
    <output qualifier> <output name> [, <option>: <option value>]
```

To show the standard output of the process in the terminal use the **Directive:**
    debug true

## Multi line comments

Multi-line comments are specified inside `/*  <COMMENTS>  */`

```groovy
/* This would be a
multi-line comment written out
of the script */
```

## Parameters

Parameters are defined inside the pipeline as `params.variable` and can be called in execution using:

    nextflow run script.nf --variable user_defined_value

## Channel factories

The factory `channel.of` creates a queue channel with values as arguments

    ch1 = channel.of (1, 3, 5, 8)
    ch.view{ "value: $it" }

## Order of assignment output

```groovy
//--snippet--
    output:
    val x 
    val 'str'
    val "${infile.name}".out

workflow{
    (ch_var, ch_str, ch_exp) = foo(ch_dummy)
    /* assignment of foo output is done as follows:
        ch_var = x
        ch_str = 'str'
        ch_exp = "${infile.name}".out
        */
}
```

## Define a function (method)

If a **return**  is not explicitly stated, groovy returns the last value evaluated.
A method can be initiated by typing `def` or a type of **return** ike `String|int`

```groovy

int fib(int n) { 
        // <- defines a return as int
        // <- method named fib receives an 'int' as input
    return n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
        // <- if 'n < 2' it returns 1
        // <- otherwise it evaluates and returns the expression
}

assert fib(10)==89

```

## Modularization

Re-use processes by using them as modules, similar to importing functions in **Python**

```groovy
include {PROCESS_NAME                   } from './modules.nf'  // <- loaded as alias
include {PROCESS_NAME as ALIAS          } from './modules.nf'
include {PROCESS1; PROCESS2; PROCESS3   } from './modules.nf' // <- multiple modules from same script
```

## Configuration file

The `nextflow.config` file determines configuration settings. By default, it is looked in the current directory or the 
script directory. 

Can be specified in the execution command using ` -c < config file >`

```groovy

name = value // <- properties are specified with this syntax

customPath = "$PATH:/my/app/folder" // <- can read environment variables

alpha.x = 1
alpha.y = 'string value...' // <- properties can be organized in scopes like this 
beta {  //<- or like this
    p = 2
    q = 'another string...'
}

params.foo = 'Ã³la' 
params.bar = 'Mundo!' // <- params in config file override the ones in other scripts

env.ALPHA = 'some value'
env.BETA = "$HOME/some/path" 
    // <- the 'env' scope defines variables to be exported into the execution environment

process {
    cpus = 10
    memory = 8.GB
}   // <- defines the directives for all processes

process foo {
    cpus = 10
}   // <- defines the directive for process foo

```

### Execution environment in configuration file

```groovy
process.container = 'nextflow/rnaseq-nf'
docker.enabled = true
    // <- docker container
    // <- if used with singularity, it will transform the docker container to a singularity img
process.container = '/some/singularity/path/image.sif'
singularity.enabled = true
    // <- singularity container requires an absolute path
process.conda = "/home/ubuntu/miniconda2/envs/nf-tutorial"
    // <- specify conda environment for execution using absolute path
```

You can also specify specific container images for each process, preventing conflicts in large containers but making it harder
to maintain. 

```groovy
process {
  withName: foo {
    container = 'some/image:x'
  }
  withName: bar {
    container = 'other/image:y'
  }
}

docker.enabled = true
```
 
# Notebook of activities

## 20230301

- When you need to run a process after all previous ones have been completed use `.collect()
- For local testing, I will use the **nextflow_test** conda environment

## 20230314

- The input of a process is the expected input when running the script, not precisely the channel that is going to be used but the format of it
    + val (meta) means that it expects a value
    + path (reads) needs file(s) from a particular PATH

- Pipeline parameters are specified as `params.parameter_name` and can be modified from the default in the pipeline by specifying it in the call as `--parameter_name`

## 20230503 - Working through the Seqera Labs tutorial I

- parameter for execution are defined as `params.variable` and can be specified in call to nextflow as `--variable XXXXX` 

- **_output_** in a process is similar to the return function in python
    - It specifies what is actually produced outside of the process 

## 20230528 - Finished working through the Seqera Labs tutorial II

- Eagle cluster requires you to use apptainer now instead of singularity, but there is an issue with username id that needs to be solved from the developer end
- Working through extended explanations from Seqera, adding notes to repository as it goes
- Learnt more about definition of operators to modify channels as necessary
- In a process defined in nextflow, the order of `output:` defines the assignment

## 202300601 - Reading through additional information from [Seqera](https://training.seqera.io/) and the [nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)

- Nextflow stages every process with the staged files in a different directory, guaranteeing that even if two files have the same name, they won't be overwritten
- Expansion of variables sometimes requires the use of single quotes 
-  How to define functions in the groovy language added note

## 20230605 - Learning about modularization

- Learn about how to use processes created in other modules, the framework for the nf-core project 
- Understood how to pipe and manage outputs from processes into others inside a workflow
- Read about defining workflow scope, workflow input/output, and calling out named workflows.
- Reviewed how to set up and call a configuration file
