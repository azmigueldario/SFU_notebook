# Metagenomics preliminary analysis for seed grant

## Objective

- To define if predominance of _Pseudomonas_ spp. affects the alpha and beta diversity of the lung microbiome in bronchiectasis

## Datasets

The primary dataset is a publicly available collection of lung 16S amplicon sequencing available at NCBI/ENA. The identifier of the project is **PRJNA605315** and the primary URL for NCBI is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA605315/. An associated paper reporting the findings of this project is located at 

The dataset of the project https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA590225 seems to contain actual metagenomic information and not just amplicon. The primary article can be found here: [Mac AogÃ¡in et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01289-7).

No other papers in the ENA or NCBI seem to contain metagenomic data for bronchiectasis by March, 2023.
